# Build a Student Database: Part 1

In this project, I developed a Bash script that utilizes SQL to manage and enter information about computer science students into a PostgreSQL database. The primary goal was to automate the data entry process and ensure efficient management of student records.

## Project Overview:
- **Objective**: Create a script that reads data from CSV files and inserts it into the PostgreSQL database for students and their associated majors and courses.
- **Environment**: This project was completed in a virtual Linux machine using Gitpod, providing a streamlined development environment.

## Features:
- Implemented a Bash script to read student and course data from CSV files.
- Used SQL queries to create and manage tables for students, majors, and courses within the PostgreSQL database.
- Validated and inserted data into the database while handling potential duplicates and ensuring data integrity.

## Technologies Used:
- PostgreSQL for database management.
- Bash scripting for automation of data processing.
- Gitpod as the development environment.

This project enhanced my skills in database management, SQL, and scripting, providing a solid foundation for future work in data management and application development.
